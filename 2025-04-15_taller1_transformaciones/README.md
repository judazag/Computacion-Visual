# 2D and 3D Transformations Summary

## 1. 2D Animation in Processing

This 2D Processing sketch animates a rectangle with circular motion, rotation, and pulsating scaling. Transformations are centered using `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()` to isolate effects.

## 2. 3D Animation in Processing (P3D)

In 3D mode (`P3D`), this sketch animates a rotating box moving in 3D space. The object rotates around X, Y, and Z axes, scales dynamically, and follows a 3D circular path using `translate()` and `rotate()`.

## 3. 2D Transformation with Matrices in Python

This Python code applies translation, rotation, and scaling to a square using homogeneous transformation matrices. Each frame is rendered and saved to create a GIF showing the animated transformation.

## 4. Animated 3D Cube with React Three Fiber

This React component renders a 3D animated cube using Three.js and React Three Fiber. The cube moves in a circular path, rotates on its axes, and scales dynamically. Lighting and camera settings enhance the 3D visualization, and `OrbitControls` allow user interaction.

## 5. Animated 3D Square in Unity with Rotation, Scaling, and Random Movement

This Unity script animates a 3D square with constant rotation, oscillating scale, and smooth movement in random directions. The movement direction changes every few seconds, adding unpredictability to the animation.
